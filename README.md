# Basic_Face_Isolation
A program that allows you to isolate the face of someone from a single image and export as a .jpg

This allows for user to input an image or a separate program to provide a usable image, and follows through a haarcascade classifier to check 
if any part of the image can be recognized as a face. This is then isolated and converted into a separate exportable image. Originally planned
to be paired with a 3d deep reconstruction program to construct animated model of face with single image.
